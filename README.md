Systematic Review Tool

## Getting Started

Systematic reviews are a time consuming, logistically challenging and labour intensive undertaking. These and other challenges have led to the development of this tools to support the systematic review process.

This project is a part of the Laboratory of Empirical Studies in Software Engineering (LESSE) at the Universidade Federal do Pampa (UNIPAMPA).

### Server Requirements

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance issues, as well as missing features.

A database is required, we recommend using mysql 5.7 (latest version as of now), actually we included a .sql for you to import, it's in the projects main folder.

### Installation Instructions

CodeIgniter is already installed, you just need to:

```
1. Clone the project.
2. Upload the folders and files to your server. Normally the index.php file will be at your root.
3. Open the application/config/config.php file with a text editor and set your base URL. If you intend to use encryption or sessions, set your encryption key.
4. Open the application/config/database.php file with a text editor and set your database settings.
```

## Overview

Any software application requires some effort to learn. Weâ€™ve done our best to minimize the learning curve while making the process as enjoyable as possible.
